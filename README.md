3) You should submit a readme. The readme file should be a short txt file with your name, email, BU ID, compilation and execution instructions that you should have tested to make sure they work (because if we follow them and they donâ€™t work you will lose points) and a simple description of each class. Nothing more than two sentences for each class. For example, for the "Player" class you could have something like "A class representing a board game player, it is created in an abstract way so it can be extended for other kind of players as well." or "it is created in a specific way tightly bound to this game to provide better specialization". Lastly, if you have implemented anything that was not required and can be considered as a bonus or if you have skipped implementing a part of the assignment you should mention that too, as well as any other special comments about your submission you may have.
